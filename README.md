# DigitalSwirl client
This is the DigitalSwirl client source code used in the Roblox version of Sonic Onset Adventure. No assets are included.

Looking back on the code, I'm not entirely happy with a lot of choices made, especially early on. I plan to address these issues in the fork for Pyrite Adventure 3, however.
